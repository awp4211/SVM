# SVM
C++课程设计

  This is my fuly application,which implements a function of handwriting number reconginize and dectet.By using the C++ Library called OPENCV 
and the algorithm called KNN(K-Nearest-Neighboor),the program can easily reading the number wrote by user.
  For the system of the application,the flow is as the following:First and formost,training the mechain to leran the trainning data of 1000
user handwrote number.Foremore,testing the learing data,and calculate the accuracy of classifier.Lastly,reading the user handwriting data 
from the GUI application,using the mechain as a dector to 'read' the number.
